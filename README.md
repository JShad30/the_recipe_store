# Recipes - Data Centric Milestone Project

This is my Milestone Project for the Data Centric Module of the Full Stack Development Course. This site has been developed to allow users to find, upload and share menus with like minded people. There is an option for the user to become a member of the site, although they do not need to to be able to find and use recipes.

I have designed the site to have a good presentation and consistent feel throughout. The home page has an introduction with scrolling images for visual effect. Cursive writing fonts have been used on the recipes and a post it note look for recipe titles, to give the website a personal feel.

## User Experience

Every page has the same Navbar and Footer, which are styled depending on the screen size the user is viewing the site in.

### Example uses of site

### Home Page

## Features

## Technology Used

This project was built using different languages, libraries and frameworks. 

### Frontend

The template pages have been written with HTML5 (http://www.html5.com/) and styled with CSS3 (www.css3.com) in the style.css file. CSS3 was used to create the mobile responsiveness seen across the whole site. It has also been used to create the hover effects for the buttons and icons. On each of the pages, you will find the jinja template engine used. A 'base.html' page has been created to contain the HTML code that is to be used on each of the pages i.e. the head, header and the footer.

jQuery (https://jquery.com/) has been used in the navbar to control the dropdown menus. Javascrpt was used to control the image scroll on the homepage and the contact section.

### Python

The site has been built using the Python based Flask framework (http://flask.pocoo.org/) and is run from the 'run.py' file. All the pages are routed from here, and contain the fuctions and logic. Python has been used to create the logic within the 'run.py' file (https://www.python.org/). The 'jinja template engine' (http://jinja.pocoo.org/) has been used within the html template pages already described.
